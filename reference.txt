Currently I have a genetic algorithm portfolio optimizer that I've defined in a python file called ga_solver.py.
I want to take this algorithm and implement it on AWS, I'm not sure how to develop the architecture around it.
The main issue I'm running into is that becase the portfolio is made of 500 stocks, a population of n=1000, and over 10000 iterations. 
I need to harness the power of HPC to accomplish these calculations. How might I go about this? Give me a rough overview utilizing as many free services as possible.
